The directory structure has been uploaded.


Using the directory structure
Each member will be working on the functionality specific to a particular user.
Suppose you are working on admin then the placement of the files will be as follows :-
HTML (and other front end files) -> WebApp\Admin\templates
CSS (and other style sheets) -> WebApp\Admin\styles
JS PHP (and other script files) -> WebApp\Admin\scripts

If at all any plugins are being used then they will be stored globally irrespective of the user you are working on in the folder named WebApp\plugins.

If any doubt then first discuss with the team and then proceed.
